## About the Role

Nestled in the heart of Bakersfield, California, where the tech industry is gradually taking root against the backdrop of this oil-rich city, we are on the hunt for a dynamic Sales Development Representative (SDR) to join our budding fintech enterprise. As a SaaS-focused company, our mission is to revolutionize financial services, making them more accessible and efficient for our clientele, ranging from savvy startups to established institutions. This position is crafted for go-getters with a knack for forging relationships and a penchant for solving the financial puzzles that today’s fast-paced world presents.

With an experience requirement of just 0-2 years, this is an incredible opportunity for those who are freshly minted from academia, or those who’ve dipped their toes in the business waters and are now ready to dive deeper. As part of a specialized team of 3-5 people, you’ll become a crucial piece of our growth endeavor, contributing to initiatives that drive our digital banking and payment processing solutions forward.

## What You'll Do

Imagine starting your day with flexible hours, allowing you to tailor your work around life, not the other way around. In this flexible environment, your primary quest will be to unearth potential leads and nurture them, guiding them through the sales journey with precision and empathy. Regular travel to nearby major cities will infuse your routine with a touch of adventure, expanding your professional network while immersing you in diverse market dynamics.

You'll be part of a close-knit team, working collaboratively to brainstorm strategies that captivate our audience. Expect to engage with financial technology platforms where your insights can make a tangible impact. You will act as the frontline for our sales engine, passionately conveying our value proposition, setting up demonstrations, and securing the initial meetings that set the stage for success.

## What You'll Need

To thrive in this role, you will need the basics of modern tech stack fluency: familiarity with Salesforce is a must. Beyond the basic knowledge, we value the certifications that prove your prowess. A Google Analytics Certification and a Salesforce Certified Administrator badge are required. These will provide a foundation to understand and interpret customer data, refining approaches and securing more fruitful engagements. 

## Nice to Have

While we have our essentials, having a broader tech foundation can only help. If you're equipped with a Google Analytics Certification or are an AWS Cloud Practitioner, you'll stand out in the crowd. Such certifications suggest a commitment to continuous learning and expansion of your technical arsenal – qualities we deeply value.

## Why Join Us

Join us, and you'll be diving into the fintech sector's deep end. Bakersfield is not just a city with a storied past; it’s a burgeoning hub of technological innovation, with a network of fintech initiatives promising growth and evolution. Our company stands at this exciting frontier, and you’ll be right there with us, shaping a new digital dawn for financial services.

## Our Tech Stack

Your daily toolkit involves some of the most advanced platforms in the industry. Our technology stack boasts Salesforce for CRM, ZoomInfo for data enrichment, and HubSpot for marketing automation, creating a seamless sales experience. LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Outreach.io round out your arsenal, empowering you to source, engage, and convert opportunities like never before.

## Benefits & Growth

As an employee, you'll enjoy a benefits package rated as Standard Plus, ensuring your health and well-being are prioritized. The greatest benefit, however, lies in the horizon of professional growth. We are committed to your development, offering extensive training programs specifically focused on personal and professional growth. As you enhance your skills, you'll find yourself poised for promotions and opportunities that extend your influence across the fintech playground.

At the heart of it all, we believe in the narrative of growth — not just for our company, but for each individual contributor. This role is not just a position. It’s a pathway, a journey beginning in Bakersfield but with the potential to reach the pinnacles of fintech innovation. Join us, and let your career story unfold in the vibrant tableau of technology and financial solutions.
