  with the local industry or have worked in Escondido before, that’s a bonus!

  recharge and enjoy life outside of work. Plus, we’re big on career growth,
  with opportunities to advance to roles like Lead Data Scientist or ML
  Architect. And don't worry, we’ve got you covered with ongoing training and
  certifications to keep your skills sharp. If this sounds like the right fit
