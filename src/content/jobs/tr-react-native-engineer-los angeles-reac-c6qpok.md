Los Angeles-Based Job Opportunity:

RTRO, a startup in Los Angeles with substantial backing, is on the hunt for a highly proficient React Native Engineer to support the development and enhancement of our Ecommerce iOS application. While this role is fully remote, we're specifically targeting candidates based in Los Angeles, CA. This role offers the chance to join a small, yet expanding team, providing you with the opportunity to significantly influence a pioneering product in a dynamic startup setting.

Your Role:

As a React Native Engineer, your mandate is to develop and sustain a high-performing Ecommerce iOS application using React Native. You'll work closely with product managers, designers, and fellow engineers to deliver fresh features and improvements. You'll write clear, scalable, thoroughly documented code. You'll also diagnose and debug application issues to enhance performance and user experience. Your role includes implementing responsive designs and ensuring seamless user experiences across various devices. You'll optimize the app for speed, reliability, and scalability, while staying current with the latest React Native developments and contributing innovative ideas to the team.

Your Skills:

You bring at least 4 years of experience in React Native, with a strong emphasis on iOS applications. You have a solid grasp of mobile development concepts, including APIs, authentication, and data management. You have experience integrating third-party libraries and APIs and possess strong knowledge of JavaScript and TypeScript. You're familiar with mobile app performance optimization techniques and have experience with CI/CD pipelines and app deployment to the Apple App Store. You have excellent problem-solving skills and attention to detail. You can work independently in a remote environment, while also collaborating effectively with a team.

Nice-to-Have:

If you have experience with Ecommerce platforms and payment integrations, that's a plus. Familiarity with design tools such as Figma or Sketch is beneficial. Knowledge of Android development and cross-platform optimizations is also a plus.

Your Rewards:

We offer an annual compensation ranging from $135,000 - $150,000, depending on your experience. Additionally, you'll have the chance to grow within a well-funded, rapidly expanding startup. We offer a comprehensive benefits package, including health insurance, paid time off, and more.

Join RTRO and be part of our small, highly technical team that's reshaping the Ecommerce experience. If you're passionate about creating excellent products and thrive in a startup environment, we are eager to connect with you!
