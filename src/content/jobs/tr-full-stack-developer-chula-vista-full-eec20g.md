## About the Role

In the vibrant tech landscape of Chula Vista, CA, a remarkable opportunity awaits for a Full Stack Developer passionate about shaping the future of SaaS (Software as a Service). Imagine being part of a dynamic enterprise software company that operates at the cutting edge of technology, yet offers the flexibility of a fully remote position. Nestled virtually in a technological haven, this role provides the unique blend of innovation and flexibility, allowing you to work from anywhere in the U.S., yet feel tethered to a vision shared by a closely-knit team. 

Being remote doesn't mean being isolated; instead, it embraces a culture of virtual collaboration, empowering individuals to contribute their best work from the comfort of their homes. Here, technology bridges distances, making the virtual workspace as effective and engaging as a physical office.

## What You'll Do

As a Full Stack Developer, you will be at the heart of our software development processes, working within a specialized team of 3-5 talented peers, each bringing their own expertise to the table. Your primary responsibilities will include designing, developing, and deploying scalable software solutions on cloud platforms, fundamentally transforming how businesses operate in the digital age. 

You’ll engage in crafting APIs using GraphQL, develop with TypeScript and Node.js, and work on the front end with React. Your role will also involve leveraging cloud services like AWS, Azure, or GCP to build robust and efficient applications. Additionally, you'll harness the power of Docker and Kubernetes to ensure seamless integration and deployment of applications. 

Your daily schedule will follow standard business hours, providing a regular rhythm to your work week, without the need for travel. The focus remains on leveraging technology to solve complex problems, with a keen emphasis on sales development and enterprise solutions.

## What You'll Need

To thrive in this role, you will need 3-5 years of full stack development experience and a penchant for remote work dynamics. Strong communication skills are essential for effective remote collaboration, ensuring that every team member is aligned and informed. Experience with remote work tools and practices will empower you to manage tasks independently, while your self-motivated attitude keeps you driven and productive.

A reliable home office setup is necessary, complete with a dependable internet connection, facilitating seamless communication and interaction with your team. Required certifications include Google Cloud Professional and AWS Solutions Architect, demonstrating your expertise in cloud technologies and infrastructure.

## Nice to Have

While not mandatory, additional certifications or experience with advanced cloud solutions will set you apart. A strong background in enterprise software or B2B tech companies can provide valuable insights into our business ecosystem, aiding in the development of more comprehensive solutions. Familiarity with Kubernetes and Docker is a definite plus, enhancing your ability to contribute to our innovative projects.
