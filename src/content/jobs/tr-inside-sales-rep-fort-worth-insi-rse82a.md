## About the Role

In the vibrant and ever-evolving landscape of Fort Worth, Texas's technology sector, nestled amidst the bustling MarTech industry, lies an exciting opportunity for an Inside Sales Representative eager to make their mark. Here in the heart of the Lone Star State, where innovation meets tradition, you will dive headfirst into a second-shift role that thrives on the dynamic energy of the late afternoon and evening hours, capturing opportunities that lead to success. Starting your day at 2:00 PM and riding the wave of potential until 10:30 PM, you will be at the forefront of transforming marketing platforms, analytics companies, and automation tools into indispensable allies for businesses hungry for growth.

Your journey begins in an environment that not only champions technology but also fosters a spirit of collaboration and creativity. Working across multiple project teams, you will become an essential thread in the fabric of a company where every call, every strategy session, and every closed deal is a victory celebrated collectively. This isn't just a job; it's a career pathway in the MarTech industry that promises to be as dynamic and rewarding as the city it calls home.

## What You'll Do

Your daily adventure will be filled with a variety of activities designed to bring out the best in your sales prowess.

Certifications are key to your success, and your Google Analytics Certification and AWS Cloud Practitioner credentials will be your passport to understanding the intricacies of digital marketing and cloud-based solutions. Your proficiency in these areas will allow you to speak with authority and insight to your clients, crafting solutions that truly fit their needs.

## Nice to Have

While your certifications will open doors, additional skills will set you apart. A willingness to continuously learn and adapt in this fast-paced industry will keep you ahead of the curve.
