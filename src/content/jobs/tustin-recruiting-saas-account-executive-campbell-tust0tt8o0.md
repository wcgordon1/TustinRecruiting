Hey there! We're excited to tell you about an Account Executive role we're helping our client fill in the heart of Campbell, CA. Nestled right next to vibrant cities like San Jose, Los Gatos, and Saratoga, this B2B SaaS company is making waves in the enterprise software sales space. If you're experienced in selling complex technical solutions and love the thrill of closing deals from $100K-$500K annually, then we're looking for you!

## Qualifications
So, what's it take to land this gig? Well, you need to be pretty comfy selling technical solutions to both IT and business leaders. In other words, you've got to speak their language. You should have a solid understanding of software implementation processes, ROI analysis, and contract negotiations. If you're a whiz with Salesforce, sales engagement platforms, and virtual demo tools, even better! Lastly, if you've got experience with consultative selling methodology and a solution-based selling approach, you're already ahead of the game.

## Responsibilities
In terms of your day-to-day, you'll be handling full-cycle enterprise software sales. That means you'll be in the driver's seat from prospecting to closing the deal and everything in between. You'll also be expected to understand and communicate the technical ins and outs of our client's software to potential buyers. And of course, contract negotiations will be a big part of your role, too.

## Pay/Benefits
Let's talk money. The salary range for this role is $82,391-$92,391 per year. Not too shabby, right? Plus, you'll have access to some pretty sweet benefits.

We can't wait to hear from you. If you're as excited about this opportunity as we are, don't hesitate to apply!
