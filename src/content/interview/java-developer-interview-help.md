### Interview Questions and Answers

#### Technical Questions

##### Question 1: Explain the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM.

- **Answer**: 
  - **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: A software development environment used for developing Java applications. It includes the JRE, an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed for Java development.
  - **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: A set of software tools for the development of Java applications. It provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java.
  - **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: An abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program. It converts Java bytecode into machine language, allowing the program to be executed. It’s platform-independent and ensures that Java applications can run on any device that has the JVM installed.

- **Examples and Context**:
  - **Development**: When developing Java applications, you need the JDK. It contains tools for writing and testing your code.
  - **Execution**: When you want to run a Java application, the JRE is sufficient. It provides the JVM and necessary libraries.

- **Real-World Scenario**: Consider a scenario where you are tasked with setting up a development environment on a new machine. You would need to install the JDK. If you’re deploying a Java application on a server, the JRE would be required.

- **Common Pitfalls**: 
  - **Mistaking the JDK for JRE**: Developers sometimes mistakenly believe that installing the JRE is sufficient for development, leading to missing development tools.
  - **Compatibility Issues**: Ensure that the version of JDK/JRE matches the application’s requirements to avoid compatibility issues.

- **Follow-Up Points**: 
  - **How does JVM handle garbage collection?**
  - **What are the different types of JDK available (like OpenJDK vs Oracle JDK)?**

##### Question 2: What is the role of the 'static' keyword in Java?

- **Answer**: The `static` keyword in Java is used for memory management primarily. It can be applied to variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes. When a member is declared static, it can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.

- **Examples and Context**:
  - **Static Variables**: A static variable is shared among all instances of a class. For example, `static int count` keeps track of the number of instances created.
  - **Static Methods**: Static methods belong to the class rather than any object instance and can be called without creating an instance of the class. For example, `Math.max()`.
  - **Static Blocks**: Used for static initializations of a class. This block of code runs once when the class is loaded.

- **Real-World Scenario**: Imagine a counter that tracks the number of instances of a class. Using a static variable, you can ensure that all instances share the same counter value, incremented each time an instance is created.

- **Reasoning Behind Best Practices**: 
  - **Use static for constants**: Variables that do not change should be declared static to prevent unnecessary memory usage.
  - **Keep utility methods static**: Methods that do not require any data from an instance of the class (like helper methods) should be static.

- **Pitfalls to Avoid**:
  - **Overusing Static**: Excessive use of static can lead to code that is difficult to test and maintain. Static members cannot be overridden, which can impact polymorphism.
  - **Thread Safety**: Static variables are shared across all threads, which can lead to concurrency issues if not handled correctly.

- **Follow-Up Points**: 
  - **How does static affect inheritance?**
  - **Can we override static methods? Why or why not?**

##### Question 3: Describe the concept of exception handling in Java.

- **Answer**: Exception handling in Java is managed via five keywords: `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, and `throws`. It is used to handle runtime errors, allowing the normal flow of the program to continue.

- **Examples and Context**:
  - **try-catch**: Enclose code that might throw an exception within a `try` block followed by one or more `catch` blocks to handle specific exceptions.
  - **finally**: A block that executes after the try-catch block, regardless of whether an exception was thrown. It’s typically used for cleanup activities.
  - **throw**: Used to explicitly throw an exception.
  - **throws**: Declares that a method can throw exceptions. It’s part of the method signature.

- **Real-World Scenario**: Consider a file reading operation. You would use a try-catch block to handle `IOException` that might occur if the file does not exist or cannot be read.

- **Reasoning Behind Best Practices**:
  - **Specific Exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions rather than a generic `Exception` to handle different error conditions appropriately.
  - **Resource Management**: Use try-with-resources for managing resources like file streams to ensure they are closed properly.

- **Pitfalls to Avoid**:
  - **Ignoring Exceptions**: Catching exceptions and doing nothing with them can hide errors and make debugging difficult.
  - **Overusing Exceptions**: Using exceptions for control flow can lead to performance issues.

- **Follow-Up Points**: 
  - **Difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?**
  - **What happens if a try block does not have a catch block following it?**
