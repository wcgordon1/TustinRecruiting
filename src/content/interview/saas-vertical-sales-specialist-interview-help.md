## Interview Questions and Answers

### Technical Questions

#### 1. Explain the SaaS delivery model and its advantages over traditional software models.

**Answer:**

  - **Scalability**: Easily scalable, allowing businesses to adjust their usage plans according to their needs.
  - **Accessibility**: Accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, facilitating remote work and collaboration.
  
  **Example**: A company using traditional software might spend thousands on licenses and hardware upgrades. Switching to SaaS, they pay a monthly fee and access the software from any location, cutting costs and improving flexibility.
