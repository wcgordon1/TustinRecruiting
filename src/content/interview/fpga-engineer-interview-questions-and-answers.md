### Interview Questions and Answers

#### Technical Questions

1. **What is an FPGA, and how does it differ from a microcontroller?**

   **Answer**:
   - **FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)** is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by the customer or designer after manufacturing. It consists of an array of programmable logic blocks and interconnects.
   - **Microcontroller**: A compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system. It typically includes a processor, memory, and input/output peripherals on a single chip.
   
   **Examples**:
