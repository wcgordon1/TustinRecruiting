### Interview Questions and Answers

#### Technical Questions

1. **What statistical models would you use to forecast sales, and why?**

   - **Answer:**
     - **Time Series Analysis:** Utilize models like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for data that has trends and seasonality. This model is robust for capturing temporal dependencies.
       - *Example:* In forecasting monthly sales for a retail company, ARIMA can account for seasonal peaks during holiday periods, which linear regression might miss.
       - **Best Practice:** Always visualize data first to understand its pattern before choosing a model.
       - **Common Pitfalls:** Failing to stationarize the series can lead to inaccurate forecasts.
       
     - **Regression Analysis:** For more straightforward relationships between independent variables (e.g., marketing spend) and dependent variables (e.g., sales).
       - *Example:* If you want to assess the impact of a new pricing strategy, regression can help quantify its effects on sales.
       - **Alternative Consideration:** If non-linearity is present, consider polynomial regression or transformations.
       - **Follow-up Points:** Discuss how to handle multicollinearity and overfitting in regression models.

2. **How would you design an A/B test for a new marketing campaign?**

   - **Answer:**
     - **Define Objective:** Clearly articulate the metric of success, such as conversion rate or click-through rate.
