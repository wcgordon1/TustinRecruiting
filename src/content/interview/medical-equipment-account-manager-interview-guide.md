This approach not only retained the client but also increased their annual purchase volume by 20%.
- **Example 2**: When launching a new product, initial sales were below expectations.

This not only resolved the issue but also strengthened the client’s trust in our service.
- **Scenario 2**: If the product issue is due to a defect, I would expedite a replacement and offer a temporary solution to minimize disruption. In one case, a client received a malfunctioning piece of equipment, and I arranged for a replacement within 24 hours and provided a complimentary service package as compensation.
