## Interview Questions

### Technical Questions

#### 1. Explain how you would value a company.
- **Answer**: Valuing a company involves several methods, the most common being Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, Comparable Company Analysis (Comps), and Precedent Transactions.
  - **DCF**: Projects future cash flows and discounts them back to present value using the company’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). 
    - *Example*: For a tech company with high growth, DCF would be suitable as it captures future potential.
    - *Pitfalls*: Be cautious of overly optimistic cash flow projections and ensure WACC accurately reflects risks.
  - **Comps**: Involves comparing the target company to similar companies using multiples such as P/E, EV/EBITDA.
    - *Example*: For a mature industry company, comps provide a market-based snapshot.
    - *Pitfalls*: Market conditions can distort multiples, so ensure a diverse set of comparables.
  - **Precedent Transactions**: Looks at past M&A deals in the same sector.
    - *Example*: Useful for industry-specific insights, but consider differences in market conditions and deal structures.
  - **Follow-up**: Discuss how you choose between methods based on context and company specifics.

#### 2. What is the impact of interest rates on valuation?
- **Answer**: Interest rates affect valuation primarily through the discount rate in DCF and through market sentiment in Comps.
  - **Impact on DCF**: Higher interest rates increase the discount rate, reducing the present value of future cash flows, thus lowering valuation.
    - *Example*: A rise in rates might decrease valuations in interest-sensitive industries like real estate.
    - *Alternative Considerations*: Consider the firm’s debt levels; high leverage amplifies interest rate impacts.
  - **Market Sentiment**: In Comps, higher rates might lead to lower market multiples as borrowing costs rise.
    - *Example*: Compare industry multiples during different rate environments.
  - **Best Practices**: Regularly update models to reflect interest changes and stress-test for rate fluctuations.
  - **Follow-up**: Explore how companies might hedge against interest rate risks.

### Behavioral Questions
