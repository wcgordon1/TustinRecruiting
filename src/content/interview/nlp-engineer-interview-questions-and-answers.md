## Interview Questions and Answers

### Technical Questions

#### Question 1: Explain the difference between stemming and lemmatization in NLP.

**Answer:**
- **Stemming**: Reduces words to their root form by removing prefixes and suffixes. It is rule-based and often results in non-dictionary root forms. For example, "running" becomes "run", and "better" might become "better" with some stemmers.
  - *Example*: Using NLTK's Porter Stemmer:
    ```python
    from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
    stemmer = PorterStemmer()
    print(stemmer.stem("running"))  # Outputs: run
    ```
  - **Pitfalls**: Can lead to over-stemming or under-stemming. For instance, "caring" might become "car", losing semantic meaning.

- **Lemmatization**: Converts words to their base or dictionary form, considering context and part of speech. It relies on vocabulary and morphological analysis.
  - *Example*: Using NLTK's WordNet Lemmatizer:
    ```python
    from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    print(lemmatizer.lemmatize("running", pos="v"))  # Outputs: run
    ```
  - **Pitfalls**: Requires more computational resources and may need additional context for accurate results.

- **Best Practices**: Choose stemming for speed and simplicity when precision is not critical; use lemmatization for applications requiring more semantic understanding.
- **Follow-up Points**: Discuss scenarios where either method might be preferred, such as real-time systems favoring stemming for speed.

#### Question 2: What is word embedding in NLP, and why is it important?

**Answer:**
- **Word Embedding**: A technique to represent words in a continuous vector space where similar words have similar vectors. Examples include Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText.
  - **Importance**: Captures semantic meanings and relationships between words, enabling algorithms to understand context better.
  - *Example*: Word2Vec captures relationships like "King - Man + Woman = Queen".
  
- **Implementation**: Using Gensim to create Word2Vec embeddings:
  ```python
  from gensim.models import Word2Vec
  sentences = [["dog", "barks"], ["cat", "meows"]]
  model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)
  vector = model.wv['dog']
  ```
  
- **Pitfalls**: Requires large datasets to effectively capture word semantics. Can also inherit biases present in the training data.
