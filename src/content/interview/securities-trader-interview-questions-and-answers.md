## Interview Questions and Answers

### Technical Questions

  - *Example*: Trading government bonds when interest rate changes are expected. Analyze yield curves and macroeconomic indicators.
- **Derivatives**: Financial contracts whose value derives from underlying assets (e.g., options, futures). Used for hedging or speculative purposes.

- **Tools**: Charts, indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI), and patterns (e.g., head and shoulders, flags).
- **Application**: Identify trends, support/resistance levels, and potential entry/exit points.
  - *Example*: Using moving averages to confirm a trend reversal. Crossovers can signal buy/sell opportunities.
  - *Scenario*: A trader identifies a bullish flag in a stock chart, suggesting a continuation of an upward trend.
