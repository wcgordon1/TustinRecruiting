### Interview Questions and Answers

#### Technical Questions

#### Question 1: What is SaaS, and how does it differ from traditional software?
- **Answer:** 
  SaaS, or Software as a Service, is a software distribution model where applications are hosted by a service provider and made available to customers over the internet. Unlike traditional software that requires installation on individual computers, SaaS can be accessed via a web browser, offering benefits like automatic updates, lower upfront costs, and scalability.
  - **Example:** In a traditional software model, a company might purchase licenses for Microsoft Office, which would need to be installed on each employee's computer. In contrast, with Microsoft 365 (a SaaS product), users access the applications online, ensuring everyone has the latest version without manual updates.

  - **Pitfalls to Avoid:** Assuming SaaS solutions are always cheaper; consider long-term subscription costs.
