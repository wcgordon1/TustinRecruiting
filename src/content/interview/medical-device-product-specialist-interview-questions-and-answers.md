## Interview Questions and Answers

### Technical Questions

#### 1. How do you ensure compliance with medical device regulations?
- **Answer**: 
  - **Example 1**: Regularly reviewing FDA and EU MDR guidelines to ensure all product specifications meet current standards. For instance, when working on a Class II device, I led a team to audit our documentation and processes, ensuring alignment with 21 CFR Part 820, which successfully passed an FDA inspection.
  - **Example 2**: Implementing a compliance checklist for each product launch. This proactive approach allowed us to identify potential regulatory issues early, reducing time-to-market by 20%.
