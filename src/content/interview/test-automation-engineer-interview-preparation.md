           WebDriver driver;

           By username = By.id("username");
           By password = By.id("password");
           By loginButton = By.id("login");

           public LoginPage(WebDriver driver) {
               this.driver = driver;
           }

           public void enterUsername(String user) {
               driver.findElement(username).sendKeys(user);
           }

           public void enterPassword(String pass) {
               driver.findElement(password).sendKeys(pass);
           }
