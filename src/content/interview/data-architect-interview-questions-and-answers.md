- **Answer**: Data architecture is the design and structure of an organization's data management resources. It defines how data is collected, stored, accessed, and used. It is crucial because:
  - **Ensures Data Quality and Integrity**: By establishing data governance and standardization protocols.
  - **Facilitates Efficient Data Management**: Through structured frameworks and models.
  - **Supports Decision-Making**: By enabling timely and accurate data insights.
  - **Example**: A retail company implemented a new data architecture to integrate their sales and inventory systems. This integration reduced data redundancy and improved reporting accuracy, allowing for better inventory management.

#### 2. How do you approach designing a data warehouse?

- **Answer**: Designing a data warehouse involves several key steps:
  - **Requirements Gathering**: Understand the business needs and data sources.
  - **Data Modeling**: Create conceptual, logical, and physical data models.
  - **ETL Design**: Plan the data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
  - **Example**: A financial institution needed a data warehouse to consolidate data from various departments. By creating a star schema model, the institution improved query performance and simplified reporting processes.

#### 3. Explain the differences between OLTP and OLAP.

- **Answer**: 
  - **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**:
    - Focuses on transactional data processing.
    - Supports high transaction volume and concurrency.
    - Example: Banking systems managing daily transactions.
  - **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**:
    - Used for data analysis and querying.
    - Optimized for read-heavy operations and complex queries.
