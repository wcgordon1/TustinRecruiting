### Interview Questions and Comprehensive Answers

#### Technical Questions

1. **What is the difference between REST and GraphQL?**

**Answer:**

- **REST (Representational State Transfer):**
  - **Structure:** Based on stateless, client-server communication, primarily over HTTP.
  - **Data Fetching:** Retrieves a fixed set of data; often requires multiple endpoints.
  - **Example:** GET /api/users/123 retrieves user data with ID 123.

- **GraphQL:**
  - **Structure:** A query language for APIs and runtime for executing those queries.
  - **Data Fetching:** Allows clients to request exactly the data they need.
  - **Example:** A single query might retrieve a user and their posts: 
    ```graphql
    {
      user(id: "123") {
        name
        posts {
          title
        }
      }
    }
    ```
- **Real-World Scenario:**
  - **REST:** Suitable for simple, well-defined API structures with limited data needs.
  - **GraphQL:** Ideal when the client requires flexibility and efficiency in data fetching.
- **Pitfalls:**
  - **REST:** Over-fetching or under-fetching data due to fixed endpoints.
  - **GraphQL:** Complexity in setting up and maintaining the schema.
- **Best Practices:**
  - **REST:** Use for simpler, stable API structures.
  - **GraphQL:** Use when flexibility and client-specific queries are necessary.
- **Follow-Up Points:**
  - Discuss potential security implications of exposing complex queries in GraphQL.
  - Consider performance impacts when choosing between REST and GraphQL.

2. **Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript. How are they used in real-world applications?**

**Answer:**

- **Concept:**
  - A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope.
  - **Example:**
    ```javascript
    function outerFunction() {
      let outerVariable = 'I am outside!';
      function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // Accesses outerVariable
      }
      return innerFunction;
    }
    const myClosure = outerFunction();
    myClosure(); // Logs: 'I am outside!'
    ```
- **Real-World Scenarios:**
  - **Data Encapsulation:** Creating private variables in modules.
  - **Event Handlers:** Maintaining state across asynchronous operations.
- **Pitfalls:**
  - **Memory Leaks:** Unused closures can consume memory.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use closures to encapsulate state and avoid polluting the global scope.
- **Follow-Up Points:**
  - Discuss how closures can be used to create factory functions or manage asynchronous code.
