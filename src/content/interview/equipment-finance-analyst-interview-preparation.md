### 20 Detailed Interview Questions with Comprehensive Answers

#### Technical Questions

1. **What are the key financial metrics you consider when evaluating an equipment finance deal?**

   - **Answer**:
     - **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Evaluates the profitability of the investment. A positive NPV indicates that the projected earnings exceed the anticipated costs.
       - *Example*: In a deal with a construction company, calculating the NPV helped determine that the leasing option provided a better return compared to direct purchase.

       - *Context*: Comparing equipment leasing options for a manufacturing firm, the IRR helped decide which option offered better long-term value.
     - **Payback Period**: The time needed to recover the investment. Shorter payback periods are generally more desirable.
       - *Outcome*: During a budget constraint, selecting an option with a shorter payback period allowed for reinvestment into other projects sooner.
