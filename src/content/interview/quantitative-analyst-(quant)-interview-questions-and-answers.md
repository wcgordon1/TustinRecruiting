## Interview Questions

### Technical Questions

#### Question 1: Explain the concept of Value at Risk (VaR) and its limitations.

**Answer:**
- **Definition**: Value at Risk (VaR) quantifies the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval. It answers the question: "What is my worst loss over a certain period, with a given level of confidence?"
- **Example Calculation**: A portfolio has a VaR of $1 million at a 95% confidence level over one week, meaning there's a 5% chance the portfolio will lose more than $1 million in one week.
- **Limitations**:
  - **Assumption of Normal Distribution**: VaR often assumes returns follow a normal distribution, which may not hold true in real-life market conditions, especially during extreme events.
  - **Does Not Predict Beyond VaR**: It does not predict the extent of loss beyond the VaR threshold.
  - **Static Assumptions**: VaR assumes static market conditions, which is rarely the case.
- **Practical Application**: Used by financial institutions to allocate capital for risk management.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Over-reliance on VaR can lead to underestimating tail risk.
- **Follow-up**: Discuss alternative measures such as Conditional VaR (CVaR) or stress testing to address VaR's limitations.

#### Question 2: How do you implement a Monte Carlo simulation for option pricing?

**Answer:**
- **Concept**: Monte Carlo simulations use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. It's widely used for pricing derivatives and assessing risk.
- **Example Implementation**:
  ```python
  import numpy as np

  S0 = 100  # Initial stock price
  K = 105   # Strike price
  T = 1.0   # Time to maturity in years
  r = 0.05  # Risk-free interest rate
  sigma = 0.2  # Volatility
  n_simulations = 10000
  n_steps = 365

  dt = T / n_steps
  payoff_sum = 0

  for _ in range(n_simulations):
      S_t = S0
      for _ in range(n_steps):
          z = np.random.standard_normal()
          S_t *= np.exp((r - 0.5 * sigma**2) * dt + sigma * np.sqrt(dt) * z)
      payoff = max(S_t - K, 0)
      payoff_sum += payoff

  option_price = np.exp(-r * T) * (payoff_sum / n_simulations)
  print("Option Price:", option_price)
  ```
- **Real-world Scenario**: Pricing complex options where analytical solutions are difficult to derive.
- **Common Pitfalls**: Ensure a sufficient number of simulations to achieve stable results; consider variance reduction techniques like antithetic variates.
- **Follow-up**: Discuss computational efficiency and ways to optimize simulation, such as parallel computing techniques.
