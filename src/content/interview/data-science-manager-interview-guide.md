### Interview Questions and Answers

#### Technical Questions

1. **Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning. Provide examples of each and discuss situations where one is more appropriate than the other.**

   **Answer:**
   - **Supervised Learning:** Involves learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It requires labeled data. Examples include regression and classification tasks.
     - *Example Context:* Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, etc. Here, you have historical price data (labeled data).
     - *Best Practices:* Suitable when the target output is known and you have historical data.
     - *Common Pitfalls:* Overfitting to the training data. To avoid this, use techniques like cross-validation.
     - *Alternative Considerations:* When data is scarce, consider using transfer learning.
   
   - **Unsupervised Learning:** Involves modeling the underlying structure or distribution in the data to learn more about it. It does not require labeled data. Examples include clustering and association tasks.
     - *Example Context:* Customer segmentation for personalized marketing strategies.
     - *Best Practices:* Useful when exploring data patterns or when labels are unavailable.
     - *Common Pitfalls:* Difficulty in evaluating the results. Use domain knowledge to validate clusters.
     - *Alternative Considerations:* Semi-supervised learning can be employed when only a small amount of labeled data is available.
