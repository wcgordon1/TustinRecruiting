Code Review Standards refer to a set of guidelines and best practices that developers adhere to during the process of reviewing code written by their peers. The primary goal is to ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality of the codebase while facilitating knowledge sharing and collaboration among team members. A candidate's ability to follow and contribute to these standards is often a measure of their competence in a development team, reflecting their understanding of programming principles, attention to detail, and ability to work collaboratively. Code review standards typically include guidelines on code style, architectural design, testing practices, security considerations, and documentation requirements.

## Common Applications

### Ensuring Code Quality
Code review standards are primarily used to uphold a high standard of code quality. By establishing clear guidelines, teams can ensure that all code contributions meet predetermined quality criteria, thereby reducing bugs and technical debt over time.

### Promoting Consistency
Consistency across a codebase is crucial for maintainability. Code review standards help enforce consistent coding styles and practices, making it easier for developers to read and understand code written by different team members.

### Knowledge Sharing
Code reviews serve as an educational tool, allowing developers to learn from each other's work. Adhering to code review standards encourages discussions about best practices and innovative solutions, which can enhance the collective skill set of a development team.

### Facilitating Onboarding
New team members can ramp up more quickly by familiarizing themselves with the code review standards. This understanding helps them integrate into the team and contribute effectively sooner.

## Safety Considerations

### Security Vulnerabilities
Part of code review standards often includes checking for potential security vulnerabilities. This proactive approach can prevent security breaches and protect sensitive data by ensuring that secure coding practices are consistently applied.

### Error Prevention
Adhering to code review standards can minimize the risk of introducing errors into the codebase. By reviewing code for adherence to these standards, teams can catch potential issues early in the development process.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Code Style Guides
Documents or tools that define the conventions for writing code, often forming a part of broader code review standards.

### Pull Request
A method of submitting contributions to a codebase where code review standards are applied to assess the changes proposed.

### Continuous Integration
A development practice that involves automatically testing code changes, often used in conjunction with code review standards to ensure quality before integration into the main codebase.

### Pair Programming
An agile software development technique where two programmers work together at one workstation, which can complement code review standards by providing immediate feedback and adherence to best practices.
