Ruby on Rails, often referred to as Rails, is a robust web application framework written in the Ruby programming language. It was created by David Heinemeier Hansson and released in 2004. The framework is designed to facilitate the development of web applications by providing a structured and efficient approach to coding. One of the core philosophies of Ruby on Rails is "Convention over Configuration", which means that the framework comes with a set of conventions that allow developers to focus more on building features rather than configuring files and settings. This approach significantly reduces the complexity and time required to develop web applications.

## Common Applications

### Web Application Development
Ruby on Rails is extensively used for developing web applications of varying complexity. Its ability to streamline repetitive tasks makes it a popular choice for startups and established companies alike.

### E-commerce Platforms
Rails is a preferred framework for building e-commerce platforms due to its powerful tools and libraries that support features like payment processing, inventory management, and shopping cart functionality.

### Content Management Systems (CMS)
Rails is also used to create custom content management systems that can be tailored to the specific needs of a business, offering greater flexibility than off-the-shelf solutions.

### Social Networking Sites
The framework's agility and scalability make it suitable for developing social networking sites that require robust user management and interactive features.

## Safety Considerations

### Security Features
Ruby on Rails includes several built-in security features to protect applications from common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

### Regular Updates
To maintain security, it's crucial to keep Rails applications updated with the latest patches and versions released by the community. Regular updates help mitigate security risks.

### Best Practices
Developers are encouraged to follow best practices such as input validation, using secure libraries, and implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to enhance application security.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### MVC Architecture
Ruby on Rails is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates an application into three interconnected components. This separation helps manage complex applications and facilitates maintainability.

### ActiveRecord
ActiveRecord is the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system used by Rails to interact with databases. It allows developers to perform database operations using Ruby code instead of SQL, simplifying database management.

### Gems
Gems are libraries or plugins that extend the functionality of Ruby on Rails applications. They provide reusable code for various features, ranging from authentication to payment processing.

### RESTful Design
Rails encourages RESTful design principles, which involve structuring web services with resource-based URLs and standard HTTP methods. This approach enhances the readability and maintainability of web applications.
