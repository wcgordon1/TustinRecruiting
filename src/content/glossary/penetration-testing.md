Penetration Testing, commonly referred to as "pen testing," is a proactive and authorized approach to evaluating the security of a computer system, network, or web application by simulating an attack from malicious outsiders (such as cybercriminals) and insiders. The primary goal of penetration testing is to identify security weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers, thereby providing the organization with the insights needed to strengthen their defenses. During a penetration test, security professionals, known as ethical hackers or penetration testers, use a variety of tools and techniques to assess the security posture of the target system. The process typically involves reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and reporting phases, culminating in a detailed report that outlines discovered vulnerabilities and potential mitigation strategies.

## Common Applications

### Network Security
Penetration testing is frequently used to assess the security of an organization's network infrastructure. This can include testing firewalls, routers, switches, and other network devices to identify vulnerabilities that could allow unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

### Application Security
Pen tests are also conducted on web and mobile applications to uncover security flaws such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure authentication mechanisms. Application pen testing helps ensure that software is resilient against attacks.

### Compliance and Regulatory Requirements
Many industries have specific regulations that require organizations to conduct regular penetration tests. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) mandates regular testing of systems that handle payment card data.

## Safety Considerations

### Authorization
Before performing a penetration test, it is crucial to have formal authorization from the organization owning the network or system. Unauthorized testing can lead to legal consequences and potential damage to systems.

### Scope Definition
Clearly define the scope of the test to ensure that only agreed-upon systems and applications are tested. This helps prevent unintended disruptions to business operations.

### Risk Management
Penetration testing can potentially impact system performance or availability. It's essential to plan tests carefully and conduct them during non-peak hours or in a controlled environment to minimize risks.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Vulnerability Assessment
While similar to penetration testing, vulnerability assessment is a broader evaluation of a system's security posture. It involves identifying and classifying vulnerabilities but does not typically include exploitation of those vulnerabilities.

### Ethical Hacking
Ethical hacking is an overarching term that encompasses penetration testing. It involves using hacking techniques to identify security threats, but with the permission and for the benefit of the organization being tested.

### Red Teaming
Red teaming is an advanced form of penetration testing that involves simulating real-world attack scenarios to test an organization's detection and response capabilities. Unlike traditional pen tests, red teaming focuses more on the organization's ability to react to an attack rather than just identifying vulnerabilities.
