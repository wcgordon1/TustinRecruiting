Container security refers to the practices and tools used to protect containerized applications from security threats both at runtime and during deployment. As organizations increasingly adopt containerization to streamline application development and deployment, ensuring the security of these environments becomes crucial. Containers encapsulate an application along with its dependencies, providing a lightweight, consistent environment across different computing platforms. This portability and consistency make containers attractive, but they also introduce unique security challenges. Container security aims to safeguard the entire container lifecycle, including building, shipping, and running containers, by implementing protective measures at various stages.

## Common Applications

### Application Development
Container security is vital in continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, where applications are frequently updated and deployed. Ensuring that each update is secure helps maintain the integrity of the application.

### Microservices Architecture
Containers are often used in microservices architectures, where applications are broken down into smaller, independent services. Security measures ensure that each microservice is protected from threats that could compromise the entire application.

### Cloud-Native Applications
Many cloud-native applications rely on containers for scalability and efficiency. Container security ensures that these applications remain protected in dynamic and distributed cloud environments.

## Safety Considerations

### Image Vulnerability Scanning
Regularly scanning container images for vulnerabilities is essential to prevent the introduction of known security flaws into the environment.

### Access Controls
Implementing strict access controls and role-based access management ensures that only authorized users and processes can interact with containers.

### Runtime Protection
Monitoring container behavior at runtime to detect and respond to anomalous activities helps protect against attacks that occur after deployment.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Docker
A popular platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containerization. Docker provides the tools needed to create and manage containers.

### Kubernetes
An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes includes built-in security features to help manage container security.

### DevSecOps
An approach that integrates security practices into the DevOps process, ensuring that security is a fundamental part of the application development lifecycle, including container security.

### Container Orchestration
The automated management of containerized applications, including deployment, scaling, and networking. Security in orchestration involves ensuring that these processes do not introduce vulnerabilities.

### Namespace Isolation
A technique used in containers to provide isolated environments for applications, limiting the potential impact of a security breach on other containers or the host system.
