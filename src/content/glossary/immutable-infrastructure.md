Immutable Infrastructure refers to a paradigm in cloud computing where infrastructure components, such as servers or virtual machines, are not modified after their initial deployment. Instead of updating or patching these components, they are entirely replaced with new versions when a change is necessary. This approach ensures consistency and reliability by reducing configuration drift and minimizing the risk of unforeseen issues arising from updates. In practice, when an update is needed, a new instance with the updated configuration is created, tested, and then deployed, while the old instance is decommissioned. This leads to a more predictable and stable infrastructure environment, as each deployment starts from a known good state.

## Common Applications

### Continuous Deployment
Immutable Infrastructure is often used in continuous deployment pipelines. By ensuring that each deployment is a fresh start with a new instance, teams can confidently push changes knowing that the new infrastructure will behave as expected.

### Microservices Architecture
In microservices architectures, where applications are broken down into smaller, independently deployable services, immutable infrastructure ensures that each service instance is consistent and can be easily replaced without affecting the overall system.

### Disaster Recovery
The predictability and consistency of immutable infrastructure make it an excellent fit for disaster recovery scenarios. Systems can be quickly redeployed from known states, minimizing downtime and data loss.

## Safety Considerations

### Resource Consumption
Since immutable infrastructure involves creating new instances rather than updating existing ones, it can lead to increased resource consumption if not managed properly. Efficient use of resources and proper instance termination policies are necessary to prevent waste.

### Deployment Complexity
Implementing immutable infrastructure can introduce complexity into the deployment process. Organizations must have robust automation and orchestration tools in place to handle the creation, testing, and deployment of new instances.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Infrastructure as Code is a practice where infrastructure configuration is managed and provisioned through code rather than manual processes. It complements immutable infrastructure by providing a repeatable and verifiable way to create and manage instances.

### Configuration Drift
Configuration drift refers to the divergence of an environment's actual configuration from its intended configuration over time. Immutable infrastructure helps mitigate this issue by ensuring environments are consistently redeployed from a known state.

### Blue-Green Deployment
Blue-Green Deployment is a release management strategy that involves running two identical production environments. Immutable infrastructure is often used in this context to seamlessly switch traffic from the old environment to the new one without downtime.
