A Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is a type of semiconductor device that is based around a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected via programmable interconnects. FPGAs can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing. This feature sets FPGAs apart from Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are custom manufactured for specific design tasks. FPGAs are particularly valuable in industries where rapid prototyping and time-to-market are crucial, as they allow for repeated design iterations and updates. They are widely used in embedded systems, where they can be configured to perform complex processing tasks traditionally handled by processors and other dedicated hardware.

## Common Applications

### Telecommunications
FPGAs are extensively used in telecommunications for signal processing tasks, including modulation, demodulation, and error correction. They are essential in the development of wireless communication standards like 4G and 5G due to their flexibility and performance.

### Aerospace and Defense
In aerospace and defense systems, FPGAs are used for radar and sonar processing, encryption, and signal intelligence. Their reconfigurability allows for quick adaptation to new threats and technologies.

### Automotive
FPGAs find applications in automotive systems for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), infotainment, and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems, where they provide the necessary computational power and flexibility.

### Consumer Electronics
In the consumer electronics space, FPGAs are employed in high-definition televisions, digital cameras, and gaming consoles to handle complex processing tasks efficiently.

## Safety Considerations

### Reliability
Ensuring the reliability of FPGA-based systems is critical, especially in sectors like automotive and aerospace where failure can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Rigorous testing and validation are necessary to ensure high reliability.

### Security
FPGAs can be vulnerable to security threats such as side-channel attacks and bitstream tampering. Implementing robust security measures, including encryption and secure boot, is essential to protect sensitive data and intellectual property.

### Power Consumption
In battery-powered devices, managing the power consumption of FPGAs is crucial. Designers must optimize the configuration to balance performance with power efficiency.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)
ASICs are custom-designed for a specific application, offering high performance and efficiency but lacking the flexibility of FPGAs. Once manufactured, they cannot be reprogrammed.

### Configurable Logic Block (CLB)
The fundamental building block of an FPGA, CLBs are used to implement logic functions. Their configuration determines the functionality of the FPGA.

### System-on-Chip (SoC)
An SoC integrates all components of a computer or other electronic system into a single chip. Some modern FPGAs include SoC capabilities, combining programmable logic with processor cores.

### Hardware Description Language (HDL)
HDLs, such as VHDL and Verilog, are used to describe the functionality of FPGAs. They allow designers to specify the configuration and behavior of the FPGA in a high-level language.
