Last-Mile Delivery refers to the final stage in the logistics and supply chain process, where goods are transported from a distribution center, warehouse, or local fulfillment hub to the final destination, typically the customer's doorstep. This stage is critical in ensuring customer satisfaction, as it directly impacts the delivery speed and reliability perceived by the end consumer. The last-mile delivery process can involve various modes of transportation, including bicycles, vans, or trucks, and often incorporates technology for route optimization, real-time tracking, and efficient resource allocation. With the rise of e-commerce, the importance and complexity of last-mile delivery have increased, making it a focal point for innovation and improvement in logistics.
