Cloud-Native Security refers to a set of security practices and principles specifically designed to protect applications and services that are built, deployed, and operated entirely within cloud environments. Unlike traditional security approaches that were developed for on-premises infrastructure, cloud-native security is inherently integrated into the application lifecycle, leveraging the unique capabilities and architecture of cloud platforms. This approach embraces the dynamic, scalable, and distributed nature of cloud computing, ensuring that security measures are automated, scalable, and resilient against modern threats. Cloud-native security encompasses a wide range of practices, including identity and access management, data protection, threat detection, vulnerability management, and compliance monitoring, all tailored to the cloud's ephemeral and often containerized environments.

## Common Applications

### Microservices Architecture
Cloud-native security is crucial in microservices architecture, where applications are broken down into smaller, independent services. Each service needs to be secured individually, often using service mesh technologies to manage communication and security policies.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Security within CI/CD pipelines is a common application of cloud-native security, ensuring that security checks and tests are integrated at every stage of the software development lifecycle. This includes automated security scans and vulnerability assessments before deployment.

### Container Security
With the rise of containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, cloud-native security focuses on securing container images, managing container orchestration, and ensuring runtime security for containerized applications.

## Safety Considerations

### Shared Responsibility Model
In the cloud, security responsibilities are shared between the cloud provider and the customer. Understanding this model is crucial for implementing effective cloud-native security measures.

### Data Protection and Compliance
Cloud-native environments require robust data protection strategies, including encryption, access controls, and compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Securing user identities and managing access control is a critical aspect of cloud-native security. This includes implementing least privilege access, multi-factor authentication, and regular audits of access permissions.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### DevSecOps
An approach that integrates security practices into the DevOps process, ensuring that security is a shared responsibility throughout the lifecycle of cloud-native applications.

### Zero Trust Security
A security model that assumes no user or application should be trusted by default, requiring verification of every access request within cloud-native environments.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
A practice of managing and provisioning cloud infrastructure using code, which also involves embedding security policies and checks into the infrastructure deployment process.

### Serverless Security
Security practices tailored for serverless computing architectures, where the focus is on securing functions, managing roles and permissions, and protecting data processed by serverless applications.
