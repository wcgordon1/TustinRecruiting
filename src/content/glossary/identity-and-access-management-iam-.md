Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a comprehensive framework designed to ensure that the correct individuals have the appropriate level of access to IT resources, thereby safeguarding sensitive data and systems from unauthorized access. IAM systems control and manage user identities and privileges, ensuring that user authentication, authorization, and access control are effectively enforced across an organization's digital environment. This involves the identification of users, the creation of accounts, the assignment of roles, and the management of permissions, along with continuous monitoring and updating of access rights as roles and responsibilities evolve. IAM solutions aim to enhance security by implementing strict access control measures while also streamlining the user experience by simplifying login processes and reducing the complexity of managing multiple credentials.

## Common Applications

### User Authentication
IAM systems employ various authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of users, such as passwords, biometrics, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and single sign-on (SSO). These methods ensure that only verified users can access specific resources.

### Authorization and Role Management
IAM frameworks facilitate the definition and management of user roles and permissions. This ensures that users have access only to the resources necessary for their job functions, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

### Access Provisioning and De-provisioning
IAM automates the process of granting and revoking access rights as employees join, move within, or leave an organization. This ensures that access is appropriate to current roles and responsibilities and reduces the risk of orphaned accounts.

### Compliance and Reporting
IAM systems provide auditing and reporting capabilities that help organizations comply with regulatory requirements by tracking access logs, monitoring user activities, and generating reports on access control measures.

## Safety Considerations

### Data Breach Prevention
Effective IAM solutions reduce the risk of data breaches by enforcing strict access controls and minimizing the attack surface available to malicious actors.

### Insider Threat Mitigation
By monitoring access patterns and implementing role-based access controls, IAM systems help mitigate the risk of insider threats by ensuring that employees only have access to the data necessary for their roles.

### Consistency in Access Policies
IAM ensures that access policies are consistently applied across all systems and platforms, reducing the potential for security gaps that could be exploited by attackers.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
A security process that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource, enhancing security beyond the use of a single password.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
An authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials, streamlining the user experience while maintaining security.

### Privileged Access Management (PAM)
A subset of IAM focused on monitoring and controlling access to critical systems and sensitive data by users with elevated privileges, such as system administrators.

### Zero Trust Security
A security model that assumes no user or system is inherently trustworthy, requiring continuous verification of user identities and device security postures, often integrated with IAM solutions.
