Insider Threat Detection refers to the strategic process of monitoring and analyzing activities within an organization to identify potential security risks posed by individuals who have legitimate access to the organization's resources. This process involves evaluating behavioral patterns, network activities, and data access habits of employees, contractors, or partners to uncover anomalies that could indicate malicious intent, negligence, or accidental breaches of security protocols. Insider threats are particularly challenging because they originate from within the organization, where individuals are often granted trusted access to sensitive information and systems. Effective detection requires a comprehensive approach combining technology, human analysis, and a deep understanding of normal business operations to distinguish between benign activities and potential threats.

## Common Applications

### Behavioral Analytics
Organizations employ advanced analytics to establish baseline behavior patterns for employees. By continuously monitoring deviations from these patterns, potential insider threats can be detected early.

### Access Control Monitoring
Tracking access to sensitive data and systems helps identify unauthorized or unusual access attempts, which could signal an insider threat.

### Network Traffic Analysis
Analyzing network traffic helps identify suspicious activities such as data exfiltration attempts or unauthorized communications with external entities.

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
DLP technologies are used to prevent the unauthorized transmission of sensitive data outside the organization, often a key indicator of insider threats.

## Safety Considerations

### Privacy Concerns
The monitoring of employee activities must be balanced with privacy considerations. Organizations should ensure that their insider threat detection practices comply with legal and ethical standards, such as informing employees about monitoring practices and ensuring data protection.

### False Positives
Overzealous monitoring can lead to false positives, where benign activities are flagged as suspicious. This can strain resources and potentially harm employee morale. Effective calibration and continuous improvement of detection systems are necessary to minimize such occurrences.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Insider Threat
A broader term encompassing all types of threats originating from within an organization, including both malicious and unintentional actions by insiders.

### User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
A cybersecurity technology that uses machine learning to analyze user and entity behavior, identifying deviations that may indicate security risks, including insider threats.

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
A system that aggregates and analyzes security data from across an organization to provide a comprehensive view of potential threats, including those from insiders.
