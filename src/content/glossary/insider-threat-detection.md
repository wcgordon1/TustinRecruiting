Insider Threat Detection refers to the systematic process of monitoring and analyzing the behavior of employees, contractors, and other individuals with access to an organization's internal systems to identify potential security risks originating from within the organization. Unlike external threats, which come from outside the organization, insider threats involve individuals who have legitimate access to systems and data but may misuse this privilege either maliciously or inadvertently. This process is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information, maintaining business continuity, and protecting an organization's reputation. Insider Threat Detection typically involves gathering and analyzing data from various sources such as user activities, communication patterns, access logs, and other relevant indicators to identify anomalies or suspicious behaviors that may indicate a potential security breach or data compromise.

## Common Applications

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems
SIEM systems are commonly employed in insider threat detection to aggregate and analyze logs from multiple sources. They help in identifying patterns and anomalies indicative of insider threats.

### User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)
UEBA solutions focus on identifying abnormal behavior by establishing a baseline of normal activity for users and entities. Deviations from this baseline can signal potential insider threats.

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Tools
DLP technologies are used to detect and prevent unauthorized data transfers, ensuring that sensitive information is not leaked, whether accidentally or intentionally, by insiders.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM) Systems
IAM systems control and monitor user access to critical systems and data, ensuring that only authorized personnel can perform sensitive operations.

## Safety Considerations

### Privacy Concerns
Insider threat detection involves monitoring user behavior, which can raise privacy concerns. It's essential to balance security needs with respect for employee privacy and comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements.

### False Positives
An excessive number of false positives can overwhelm security teams and lead to alert fatigue. It's crucial to fine-tune detection systems to minimize these occurrences while maintaining a high detection rate.

### Employee Trust
Overly intrusive monitoring can erode employee trust and morale. Organizations should communicate clearly about the measures in place and ensure they are applied fairly and transparently.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Insider Threat
A broader term that includes any insider who poses a potential risk to an organization's security, either maliciously or unintentionally.

### Anomaly Detection
A component of insider threat detection, focusing on identifying deviations from established patterns of behavior that may indicate a security threat.

### Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
EDR solutions provide continuous monitoring and analysis of endpoint devices to detect and respond to potential threats, including those posed by insiders.

### Behavioral Analytics
A technique used in insider threat detection to understand and model user behavior patterns, helping to identify unusual activities that may signal a threat.
