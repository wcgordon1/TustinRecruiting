Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security method that requires users to present multiple forms of verification before gaining access to a system or service. This approach is designed to enhance security by combining two or more independent credentials: something the user knows (knowledge), something the user has (possession), and something the user is (inherence). By requiring additional verification factors beyond a simple password, MFA mitigates the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised or weak passwords. The goal is to create multiple layers of defense, making it more difficult for an unauthorized individual to access a target, such as a network, database, or application.

## Common Applications

### Online Banking
MFA is widely used in online banking environments to protect sensitive financial information. Users may be required to enter a password and then confirm their identity using a one-time code sent to their mobile device.

### Corporate Networks
Businesses implement MFA to secure access to corporate networks and sensitive data. Employees might use a combination of passwords and biometrics, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to authenticate.

### Email Services
Email providers often use MFA to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts. This typically involves entering a password and a code sent via SMS or generated by an authenticator app.

### Cloud Services
Cloud service providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure offer MFA to ensure that only authorized users can access cloud resources, adding a layer of security over basic username and password authentication.

## Safety Considerations

### Strength of Factors
The security of MFA depends on the strength and independence of its factors. For example, using a password and an SMS code is generally considered less secure than using a password combined with a biometric factor due to vulnerabilities in SMS.

### Usability and Accessibility
While MFA enhances security, it can also introduce challenges related to usability and accessibility. Users may find it inconvenient, which can lead to resistance or the selection of weaker, more convenient factors.

### Backup Options
Organizations should provide backup authentication methods in case users are unable to access their primary MFA method, such as when losing access to a mobile device used for receiving codes.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
A subset of MFA, Two-Factor Authentication requires precisely two verification factors. It is a more common implementation of MFA due to its balance between security and convenience.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
Single Sign-On allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications. MFA can be integrated into SSO systems to enhance their security by requiring additional verification when logging in.

### Biometric Authentication
A type of authentication using inherence factors, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or voice patterns, to verify identity. It is often used in conjunction with other factors in an MFA setup.

### Authenticator Apps
These are mobile applications like Google Authenticator or Authy that generate time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) used as an additional factor in MFA systems.
