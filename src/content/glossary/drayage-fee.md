Drayage Fee refers to the charge applied for the transportation of freight over short distances, often within the same metropolitan area. This term is commonly associated with the movement of shipping containers from ports to nearby warehouses, distribution centers, or rail terminals. Drayage is a critical component of the logistics and supply chain industry, bridging the gap between long-haul transportation modes such as ocean shipping, rail, and trucking. The fee is generally calculated based on factors such as distance, time, container weight, and any additional services required, such as chassis rental or demurrage.

## Common Applications

### Port to Warehouse Transport
The most common application of drayage fees is in moving containers from seaports to local warehouses. This step is crucial for decongesting ports and ensuring that goods quickly enter the supply chain for further distribution.

### Intermodal Transport
Drayage fees are also applied when containers are transferred between different transportation modes, such as from a ship to a train (or vice versa), at intermodal terminals. This ensures a seamless transition in intermodal freight transport.

### Last-Mile Delivery
In some cases, drayage services are employed for the final leg of the delivery process, especially in urban areas where large trucks may have limited access.

## Safety Considerations

### Equipment Safety
The drayage process often involves specialized equipment such as gantry cranes and reach stackers. Ensuring proper maintenance and operation of such equipment is crucial to prevent accidents and injuries.

### Road Safety
Drayage drivers must adhere to road safety regulations, including weight limits and secure loading practices, to avoid accidents and ensure safe transportation of goods.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Demurrage
Demurrage refers to the charges applied when a container is not moved from the port or terminal within the allotted free time. This is closely related to drayage as timely drayage services can help avoid demurrage fees.

### Chassis Fee
A chassis fee is often associated with drayage services, as it covers the cost of leasing the chassis used to transport shipping containers over short distances.

### Intermodal Transport
Intermodal transport involves the use of multiple modes of transportation for a single shipment, such as ships, trains, and trucks. Drayage services are an integral part of intermodal transport, facilitating the movement of goods between different modes.

### Short-Haul
Short-haul refers to the transportation of goods over relatively short distances, typically within the same region or metropolitan area. Drayage is a specific type of short-haul transport focused on the logistics chain.
