In-Service Training refers to the comprehensive, hands-on educational program provided to hospital staff, including nurses, technicians, and surgeons, to ensure the effective and safe utilization of new medical devices. This training is crucial for healthcare professionals to gain familiarity with the functionalities, operational procedures, and maintenance of the devices. It often involves practical demonstrations, interactive sessions, and supervised practice to build proficiency. In-Service Training is essential in the medical device industry to enhance clinical outcomes, improve patient safety, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

## Common Applications
