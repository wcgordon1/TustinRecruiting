A Pocket Listing refers to a real estate property for sale that is not publicly advertised or listed on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS). Instead, pocket listings are marketed privately by real estate agents. This approach allows sellers to maintain a level of privacy and control over the sale of their property, and it enables agents to potentially secure a deal without involving the broader market. Pocket listings often involve direct outreach to potential buyers or a select group of agents within an exclusive network. While pocket listings can provide advantages in terms of discretion and exclusivity, they may also limit the exposure of the property, potentially affecting the sale price and terms.

## Common Applications

### Exclusive Sales
Pocket listings are typically used for high-value properties or when sellers desire privacy, such as celebrities or individuals in sensitive situations.

### Market Testing
Sellers might use a pocket listing to gauge interest or test pricing strategies before deciding to list publicly.

### Quick Transactions
In some cases, pocket listings can facilitate quicker sales as they target pre-qualified buyers who are ready to make an offer.

## Safety Considerations

### Limited Exposure
While pocket listings can provide privacy, they also limit the pool of potential buyers, which can affect the property's market value and the seller's negotiating power.

### Legal and Ethical Concerns
Real estate agents must ensure they comply with local regulations and ethical standards, as pocket listings can sometimes conflict with fair housing laws and MLS rules.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Off-Market Listings
Similar to pocket listings, off-market properties are not listed on the MLS. However, they might still be marketed more broadly than pocket listings.

### Private Listings
These are listings that are kept within a closed network of agents and potential buyers, often similar to pocket listings in their approach.

### Exclusive Listing Agreement
A contract between a seller and a real estate agent that gives the agent exclusive rights to sell the property, which may sometimes result in a pocket listing.
