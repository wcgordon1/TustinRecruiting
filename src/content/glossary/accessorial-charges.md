Accessorial charges are additional fees levied on freight shipments for services that go beyond basic transportation. These charges are applied when certain services are required to ensure the safe and efficient delivery of goods, or to accommodate specific needs of the shipper or consignee. Examples of such services include the use of a liftgate for loading or unloading heavy items, inside delivery where items are transported beyond the curb to an interior location, and detention time which compensates carriers for delays when loading or unloading exceeds the allotted free time. Accessorial charges can significantly impact shipping costs and are therefore an important consideration for logistics planning.

## Common Applications

### Liftgate Service
A liftgate is a hydraulic platform attached to the back of a truck, which is used to lift heavy goods from the ground to the truck bed or vice versa. This service is commonly required when there is no loading dock available at the pickup or delivery location.

### Inside Delivery
Inside delivery involves transporting goods into a building rather than leaving them at the curbside. This service is often necessary for large or heavy items that cannot be easily moved by the recipient.

### Detention Time
Detention charges occur when a carrier's vehicle is held up beyond the allotted free time for loading or unloading. This compensates the carrier for lost time and potential delays in their delivery schedule.

### Residential Delivery
Deliveries to residential areas often incur additional charges due to the challenges associated with navigating smaller streets, potential lack of unloading facilities, or the requirement for additional handling.

## Safety Considerations

### Equipment Safety
When using equipment such as liftgates, it is crucial to ensure that all safety protocols are followed to prevent accidents. Proper training for personnel operating the equipment is essential to minimize risks of injury or damage to goods.

### Personnel Training
Handling special services like inside delivery requires trained personnel to safely navigate and maneuver goods through potentially confined or crowded spaces, minimizing the risk of injury to handlers and damage to the property.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Freight Classification
Freight classification involves categorizing goods based on factors such as density, stowability, handling, and liability. This classification can influence the base shipping rate and potential accessorial charges.

### Bill of Lading
A bill of lading is a legal document between a shipper and carrier detailing the type, quantity, and destination of the goods being carried. It may also specify any agreed-upon accessorial services.

### Tariff
A tariff is a document that outlines applicable rates, charges, and rules associated with the transportation of goods. Accessorial charges are typically outlined within the tariff, providing transparency for shippers and consignees.

### Fuel Surcharge
A fuel surcharge is an additional fee imposed by carriers to account for fluctuating fuel costs. While not an accessorial charge, it is another cost factor that can impact the overall shipping expense.
