Privilege Escalation is a type of security exploit in which an attacker gains elevated access to resources that are typically protected against unauthorized access. In a computing context, this means that the attacker is able to gain permissions that are beyond their current level of access. Privilege escalation can take two primary forms: vertical and horizontal. Vertical privilege escalation involves gaining higher-level permissions, such as those of an administrator or root user. Horizontal privilege escalation occurs when the attacker gains access to another userâ€™s account with similar permission levels.

## Common Applications

### Exploitation Techniques
Privilege escalation is often achieved through various exploitation techniques, such as exploiting software vulnerabilities, misconfigured systems, or using social engineering tactics. Attackers may exploit unpatched software flaws or utilize malware to gain unauthorized access.

### Testing and Assessments
In penetration testing, privilege escalation is used to evaluate the security posture of an organization. Ethical hackers simulate attacks to identify vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of existing security controls.

## Safety Considerations

### Least Privilege Principle
Organizations should implement the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users and applications have the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their functions. This limits the potential damage in the event of a security breach.

### Regular Audits and Updates
Conducting regular security audits and keeping all systems and software up to date can help prevent privilege escalation attacks. Vulnerability management programs should be in place to address any identified weaknesses promptly.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### Vertical Privilege Escalation
An attack where the user gains higher-level privileges, such as administrator or root access, often through exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

### Horizontal Privilege Escalation
An attack where the user gains access to another user's account with similar levels of access, often by exploiting session management flaws or using stolen credentials.

### Least Privilege
A security principle advocating that users should only have the access necessary to perform their job functions, reducing the risk of privilege escalation.

### Vulnerability Management
The process of identifying, classifying, and mitigating vulnerabilities, which is crucial in preventing privilege escalation exploits.
