Authentication & Authorization refer to the processes used in computing and information systems to verify the identity of a user or system (authentication) and to determine what resources or data they are allowed to access (authorization). Authentication is the first step, ensuring that the entity requesting access is who they claim to be. This is typically achieved through credentials like passwords, biometric data, or tokens. Authorization, on the other hand, occurs after authentication and involves granting or denying permission to access certain resources or perform certain actions based on the authenticated identity's permissions or roles. Full stack developers often implement these processes using technologies such as OAuth (an open standard for access delegation), JWT (JSON Web Tokens, which are compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties), and session-based systems, which maintain user state across multiple requests in a web application.

## Common Applications

### Web Applications
Authentication and authorization are critical in web applications for protecting user data and ensuring that users have appropriate access levels. They are implemented in various ways, such as via login forms that utilize OAuth or JWT for session management.

### Mobile Applications
Similar to web apps, mobile apps use authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to user-specific data and services. Often, these apps integrate with third-party services using OAuth for secure token-based authentication.

### APIs
APIs require authentication and authorization to protect endpoints from unauthorized access. Common methods include API keys, OAuth tokens, and JWTs, ensuring only authorized requests are processed.

## Safety Considerations

### Data Protection
It is essential to ensure that authentication data, such as passwords and tokens, are stored securely, using encryption and hashing techniques to prevent unauthorized access.

### Session Management
Proper session management is crucial to prevent session hijacking and replay attacks. This includes implementing secure cookie practices, using HTTPS, and regularly updating session tokens.

### Access Control
Implementing the principle of least privilege, where users have the minimum level of access necessary, helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized actions within a system.

## Related Terms or Concepts

### OAuth
An open standard for access delegation commonly used to grant websites or applications limited access to a user's information without exposing passwords.

### JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties, often used in authentication and information exchange.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
An authentication method that requires two or more verification factors to gain access, enhancing security beyond single-factor methods like passwords.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
An authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials, improving usability and security.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
A method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise.
