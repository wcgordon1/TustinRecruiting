The term "Conforming Loan Limit" refers to the maximum loan amount that can be purchased or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in the United States. These limits are established annually by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and are based on the median home prices in a given area. The purpose of setting these limits is to standardize mortgage lending practices, promote liquidity in the housing market, and ensure that borrowers have access to affordable home financing options. Loans that fall within these limits are considered "conforming" and typically offer lower interest rates compared to "non-conforming" or "jumbo" loans, which exceed these limits and often have stricter underwriting guidelines.

## Common Applications

Conforming loan limits are primarily used by lenders when determining the eligibility of a mortgage for sale to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. This is crucial for lenders as selling these loans to the GSEs allows them to replenish their funds and continue offering mortgages to new borrowers. Homebuyers and refinancing homeowners benefit from conforming loans because they generally come with lower interest rates and more favorable terms than non-conforming loans. Additionally, conforming loan limits are often used by financial institutions to structure loan products and assess risk.

## Safety Considerations

While conforming loans are generally considered safer investments due to their adherence to GSE guidelines, it is important for borrowers to assess their financial situation before taking on any mortgage. Borrowers should ensure they are capable of meeting monthly payments and other financial obligations to avoid foreclosure. Lenders are also required to conduct thorough underwriting processes to evaluate the borrower's creditworthiness, ensuring that conforming loans maintain their relatively low-risk status.

### Jumbo Loan

### Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)

### Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV)
