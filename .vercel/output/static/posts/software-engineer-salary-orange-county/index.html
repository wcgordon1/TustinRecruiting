<h3 id="comparison-to-silicon-valley">Comparison to Silicon Valley</h3>
<p>Silicon Valley is often considered the benchmark for software engineering salaries in the United States. In San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley, software engineers earn an average salary of over $108,000, according to <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/san-jose-software-engineer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,8_IM761_KO9,26.htm">Glassdoor</a>. This figure is higher than the average salary in Orange County, showcasing a difference of approximately $25,000.</p>
<p>The higher average salary in Silicon Valley can be attributed to the region’s higher cost of living and the concentration of tech giants that drive up the demand for highly skilled software engineers. However, local market dynamics in Orange County, where there is a relative shortage of top talent, can also push salaries higher for specific roles and experience levels, as noted on <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-is-the-job-market-for-software-engineers-in-Orange-County-and-Los-Angeles-CA-Whats-the-expected-salary-for-each-respective-counties">Quora</a>.</p>
